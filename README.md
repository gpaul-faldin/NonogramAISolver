# NonogramAISolver

!!THE CODE ARE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE BRANCHES INSIDE THIS REPOSITORY!!

The aim for those projects was to make my first complex AI to solve a game that I play on my phone.
I started with NEAT which I had a small experience with and then continued with Deep learning.
It was a fun and entertaining way to improve and learn skills using/building AI's

Some pieces of code can be a good starting point for other AI or related project (nonogram game class, ect..)

FYI:
All the nonogram grids where kindly scrap from the android game called "Falcross"
